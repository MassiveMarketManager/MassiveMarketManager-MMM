# MassiveMarketManager - MMM

An advanced AI-driven trading system designed for decentralized finance (DeFi).  
TradingBro integrates **machine learning algorithms**, **deep learning models**, and **audited smart contracts** to enable fully automated spot trading on leading L2 networks (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism).  

The platform combines three core layers:  
- **Data & Analytics** ‚Äî continuous ingestion of on-chain market data, calculation of technical indicators, and generation of trading signals.  
- **Decision & Execution** ‚Äî ML/DL models for short-term market prediction, integrated with a robust risk-management engine and secure smart-contract execution.  
- **User Experience** ‚Äî a modular backend powering a responsive frontend dashboard that provides transparency, performance metrics, and strategy customization.  

This architecture allows MMM to operate as a scalable, modular DeFi instrument capable of supporting multiple strategies, adapting to volatile markets, and ensuring security through strict key management and contract audits.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Requirements:** Docker & Docker Compose  

1. Clone the repo and create a `.env` file (see example below).  
2. Start services:  
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```  
3. Access:
   - API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
   - Dashboard: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
   - Database: `localhost:5432`  

**Example `.env`:**
```env
POSTGRES_USER=mmm
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mmm_password
POSTGRES_DB=mmm
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
APP_PORT=8080
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update
TZ=UTC
```

## üîê Security Notes

- No private keys or secrets are stored in Git.  
- API keys, seed phrases, and sensitive configs must be provided via environment variables or secret managers.  
- Smart contracts undergo audits and use trusted libraries.
